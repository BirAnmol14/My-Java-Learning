Used in GUI applications.
Based on event based programs.
Example some code runs and does something at an unpredictable point of time.
Like when button press or timer ends.
Their listener code should be run in background
And respond to the changes
The change occurs in *SUBJECT* -> which is handled by *Listener/Observer* .
The Observer should be running in background and the subject should not know.
Like OnClickListener in Android.
In java the Listener is an interface like ABCListener which has a method called run().
Now you have to implement this Listener and provide code for this method.
The subject maintains a list of these Observers and passes data to fire an event.
