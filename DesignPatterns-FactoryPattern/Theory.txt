When you want objects that implement same interface
or having same parent
Creating object complex
e.g.: lot of constructor parameters
Possible to simply choice of objects
-----------------------------------------------
A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says 
that just define an interface or abstract class for 
creating an object but let the subclasses decide 
which class to instantiate.
-----------------------------------------------
Makes it easier to build these objects...
